CS 255 Project


**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

DrivePass is a company that aims to provide people, who are starting to test for their driver's license, with tools that can help them succeed. They are looking for a web-based system that will provide users with lessons, tests, and practical tests. 

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think in general, my diagrams were done well. UML diagrams are an important area to start with and will lay the ground work for productivity down the line. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think in general, I could have added more detail to the business requirements document. I feel that I provided an adequate amount of information but I think it would always benefit to be more specific and add more information. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are always very important as they are the purpose for most applications. In this case, the user is specific to people starting their driving test, but there are no other demographical differences. Therefore, as it it pertains to the user, it is very important that this system is easily accessible and usable to all possible users. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I think the diagrams we used here are the most important feature to use in software design going forward. Mapping and planning out what the code is going to look like will help the coding process be faster and more effiecient.
